# Data
In support of our regional transportation planning efforts, MTC produces typical weekday summaries of [Caltrans PeMS Data](http://pems.dot.ca.gov/).  Our work motivates us to understand "typical" traffic conditions, which we usually define to occur Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays in the months of March, April, May, September, October, and November -- excluding holidays.  

The procedures we use to process the data are documented and made available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/pems-typical-weekday).  The processed data is then made available as flat files that can be found in the `pems-typical-weekday` folder [here](https://mtcdrive.box.com/share-data).  Please note that the GitHub repository contains Tableau workbooks that consume the flat files.  The Tableau files are rendered is web-based interactives on the [Flows and Speeds](/pems-typical-weekday/flows_speeds/) tab of this website.
